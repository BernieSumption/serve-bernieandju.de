		<description><![CDATA[So, I&#039;m adding this waaaay late, but you missed off my absolute FAVOURITE.

Shallots. An Australian uses the term &#039;shallot&#039; for what we Brits would call a &#039;spring onion&#039;. I especially like this one, as it throws up a quandary: given that the term &#039;shallot&#039; has been re-allocated, what do you then call shallots?

I have asked quite a few people this question. Mostly the problem is solved by not selling shallots, or not knowing what they are. However, the actual response is that they are &#039;eshalots&#039;. Pronounced eh-shal-ots.

In other words, the Australians use the French term for shalots, pronounced in the manner Jude describes above.

This then further confuses me when you start talking about aubergines or courgettes . . .]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi James,

It&#039;s a small world!

We had a 5.0 quake while we were there, which was strong enough to wake us up. We figured if the YMCA hadn&#039;t fallen down yet, it probably wasn&#039;t going to.

I likewise worried whether the city would be irreversibly changed, but I think populations have a way of getting over these things. Perhaps the recovered city will be different from the old one, but in any case I suspect in time this will just become another talking point on a open-top-bus city tour &quot;This area that we&#039;re passing contains one of central Christchurch&#039;s few remaining intact neighbourhoods of late 1800&#039;s housing, spared from the 2011 quake by the geological properties of the local area&quot; or something like that. While kids pick their noses and wonder when they&#039;re stop;ping for lunch, all the time not really making a connection between what&#039;s being said and the implication that any local over 30 will remember something really horrible happening.

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Bernie - I&#039;m a good friend of Jo Shone, met you way back at Oxford and just stumbled across your blog post via Jude&#039;s tweet that used the &quot;#eqnz&quot; hashtag that I follow....6 degrees of separation, or something!

It&#039;s great to see that you&#039;ve visited Christchurch and chose to write about it, they need all the help they can get! I was in Chch in April/May 2011 as my girlfriend&#039;s Uncle &#038; his family live there. They&#039;d invited us out in Sep/Oct 2010 and we were all set to visit in the April/May of 2011 when the Feb 2011 quake struck.

Their home was badly damaged in the Feb quake, but luckily we were still able to stay with them and spent 3 wonderful weeks exploring the Canterbury region, which is an amazing place and has so much to offer. It was inspiring to see how resilient the people of Chch were only two months after the big quake, and walking around the cordon was heart breaking - it had a long lasting affect on me.

Aside from having no city centre, the residents of Chch are still living with regular aftershocks (we experienced many, including a 5.3 which was scary as hell!) and pretty much every aspect of their &#039;normal&#039; daily life was affected.

My girlfriend&#039;s family were in the &#039;residential red zone&#039; which consists of over 6,500 homes where the land has been so badly damaged by quakes and subsidence it has been deemed beyond repair for at least 5 years. The Govt. has slowly begun purchasing homes &#038; land from residents and in November 2011 they had to leave the remnants of their 100+ year old home, which will eventually be bulldozed.  They&#039;ve now moved 30km west of the city to Darfield and bought a new home and business, starting again in their mid 50&#039;s, instead of retiring as they&#039;d planned to do!

Many of their friends that we met are still living in limbo, in quake damaged homes that haven&#039;t been fully assessed or classified one way or the other. It&#039;s really hard to know that not only is the city centre off limits and going to be a completely different place when it is finally rebuilt, but entire suburbs will be wiped off the map too - the face of the entire city if going to change. The psychosocial scars are certainly going to take as long to heal (if not longer) than the physical ones.

But even a couple of months after the quake, we left Chch with a great sense of hope, it&#039;s a long road to recovery for them, but as your photos have shown 8 or 9 months after I was there - they&#039;re a resilient bunch and Christchurch will rise again - and I plan to go back and see it!

Sorry for hijacking your blog post, it&#039;s just good to see someone else who has been there and seen what&#039;s happening as it&#039;s hard to comprehend unless you&#039;ve seen it with your own eyes.

Cheers, James]]></description>
