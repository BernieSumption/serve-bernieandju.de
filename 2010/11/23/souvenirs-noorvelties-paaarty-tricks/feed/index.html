		<description><![CDATA[Good to hear you are finally on your travels.  A long way to go just to avoid Chris and Charlotte&#039;s wedding!
If you are in New Zealand early in 2012 we might see you there, having made arrangements beforehand!
Our news - very exciting to us - is that our granddaighter, Maygi, has got her visa so will be coming with her Mum from Thailand on 10 Dec to live in Leeds.  She is looking forward to the snow.  Andrew thinks the novelty may wear off!
Keep us in touch
Love from your Aunt and Uncle]]></description>
