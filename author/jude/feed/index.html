				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We&#8217;ve now left Sydney for the final time on this trip. I miss the place already but my final thought on it is that it&#8217;s just a little bit, umm well, odd:</p>
<p>I realised whilst staring blankly at this sign on my way to work that I had fallen through the looking glass and woken up in a parallel universe.</p>
<p><a title="Sydney: A parallel universe? by Bernie Sumption, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bernieandjude/7199994510/"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8145/7199994510_5618c6a15e_z.jpg" alt="Sydney: A parallel universe?" width="640" height="480" /></a></p>
<p>One of the most obvious oddities is that the seasons are backwards &#8211; winter is from June to August and the height of summer is from Christmas to the end of February. </p>
<p>There are also loads of streets and areas in Sydney with familiar names that have a completely different character to their UK name sakes. Canterbury is an inner west suburb filled with unemployed layabouts and there&#8217;s not a cathedral or fancy school in sight. There&#8217;s no train station in Paddington and the only bears there who like marmalade are the customers of one of it&#8217;s many gay clubs. New South Wales does not contain many sheep or coal mines and has recently experienced a 10 year drought. [Kings Cross is just like its London counterpart: soulless oversized boozers full of fake-tanned man peacock hybrids and aggro drunken whores &#8211; Bernie]</p>
<p>Sydney&#8217;s Hyde Park is definitely still a park, but it&#8217;s smaller and the pigeons are a bit scary looking.</p>
<p><a title="Sydney: A parallel universe? by Bernie Sumption, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bernieandjude/7199987854/"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8154/7199987854_a137513297_z.jpg" alt="Sydney: A parallel universe?" width="640" height="480" /></a> </p>
<p>They don&#8217;t have the Salvation Army but an enigmatic institution called The Salvos instead. You&#8217;ll also find this establishment around the place:</p>
<p><a title="Sydney: A parallel universe? by Bernie Sumption, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bernieandjude/7199983158/"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7230/7199983158_9df9fe95f6_z.jpg" alt="Sydney: A parallel universe?" width="640" height="480" /></a></p>
<p>It is Burger King but I have no idea why it&#8217;s called Hungry Jacks here. In fact many of the things people say mean something different (see my <a href="http://bernieandju.de/2011/07/31/lingua-australia/" title="Lingua Australia">earlier post</a> for heaps more examples).</p>
<p>There are loads of things about life in Sydney that are familiar to a Brit but the city is patently not London no matter how much the original settlers (and some of the later ones) might have wanted it to be. It&#8217;s the same same but different, enough so that if you think about it for too long it starts to mess with your head. Personally I&#8217;ve grown to love the sense of unfamiliar familiarity and I now expect I&#8217;ll go through it in reverse when I get back to the UK. </p>
<p>But whilst I&#8217;m still in Australia I can at least console myself with a bag of sweets from Woolies.<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Because the Australian government (arguably quite rightly) suspects that poms will carry on working illegally when their working holiday visas expire we have been forced, forced I say, to take a holiday from our holiday in order to reenter oz on a tourist visa. </p>
<p>We decided to take the opportunity to get some climbing in at one of the most stunning locations in the world: Railay beach on Thailand&#8217;s Andaman Coast. Railay has a tonne of climbing routes at different grades. They&#8217;re on limestone cliffs which either come right down to the sea or are surrounded by lush jungle. We had loads of fun over two days with our guide Kung.</p>

</p>
<p>We also spent a day deep water soloing &#8211; climbing without a rope on sea cliffs and diving (or falling) off when you&#8217;re done. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bernieandjude/6977759434/" title="Deep water soloing near Railay Beach by Bernie Sumption, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7242/6977759434_f0dfe13d57_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="Deep water soloing near Railay Beach"></a></p>
<p>And we managed to fit in a spot of bouldering</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bernieandjude/6977757534/" title="Bouldering, Phra Nang beach by Bernie Sumption, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7059/6977757534_2142c95a54_z.jpg" width="480" height="640" alt="Bouldering, Phra Nang beach"></a></p>
<p>[This particular bouldering session lasted about ten seconds because the rocks are covered in little razor-sharp flakes. That was in two sessions of five seconds each: the first when I climbed on, wailed like a girl and dropped off, and the second when Jude made me get back on again because she missed the photo &#8211; B]</p>
<p>And some posing</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bernieandjude/7123839165/" title="Phra Nang Beach by Bernie Sumption, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8026/7123839165_1309329446_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="Phra Nang Beach"></a></p>
<p>Before chilling out and watching the sunset</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bernieandjude/7123841595/" title="Sunset, Railay Beach by Bernie Sumption, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7243/7123841595_f5b4f094b6_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="Sunset, Railay Beach"></a></p>
<p>We also discovered that our climbing guide Kung actually has two awesome jobs. He&#8217;s an instructor by day and a fire juggler by night. How cool is that?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Nullarbor is big. You just won&#8217;t believe how vastly, hugely, mind-bogglingly big it is. I mean, you may think it&#8217;s a long way down the road to the chemist&#8217;s, but that&#8217;s just peanuts to the Nullarbor. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s been looming large in this stage of our trip for weeks now. We&#8217;ve been telling people that &#8220;We&#8217;re going to cross the Nullarbor&#8221; in hushed tones and fancying that they start looking at us with new found respect.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bernieandjude/7007912717/" title="Crossing the Nullarbor by Bernie Sumption, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7044/7007912717_525b4feb83_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="Crossing the Nullarbor"></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bernieandjude/6861754432/" title="Crossing the Nullarbor by Bernie Sumption, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7072/6861754432_453fc473ed_z.jpg" width="640" height="438" alt="Crossing the Nullarbor"></a></p>
<p>As well as being big the Nullarbor is flat and the road is straight. Very straight.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bernieandjude/6861821678/" title="Crossing the Nullarbor by Bernie Sumption, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7120/6861821678_0ec282d11a_z.jpg" width="640" height="408" alt="Crossing the Nullarbor"></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bernieandjude/7007931367/" title="Crossing the Nullarbor by Bernie Sumption, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7045/7007931367_36bdb27a42_z.jpg" width="640" height="467" alt="Crossing the Nullarbor"></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bernieandjude/7007915131/" title="Crossing the Nullarbor by Bernie Sumption, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7081/7007915131_cc3af63e4b_z.jpg" width="640" height="326" alt="Crossing the Nullarbor"></a></p>
<p>That&#8217;s a photo of our Sat Nav telling us that we&#8217;ve got another 675 kilometres to go until the next turning (and we only thought to take the picture when we were half way across). No wonder the only people that live here work in the service stations that keep travellers of questionable sanity well supplied with pies and trinkets.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bernieandjude/7007883435/" title="Crossing the Nullarbor by Bernie Sumption, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7277/7007883435_4eb98318bc.jpg" width="373" height="500" alt="Crossing the Nullarbor"></a></p>
<p>The Nullarbor is the largest piece of continuous limestone in the world. It&#8217;s flat for hundreds of kilometres, then plunges abruptly into the sea.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bernieandjude/6861759548/" title="Crossing the Nullarbor by Bernie Sumption, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7232/6861759548_a846366155_z.jpg" width="640" height="392" alt="Crossing the Nullarbor"></a></p>
<p>It&#8217;s riddled with caves called &#8220;blowholes&#8221;. These are huge underground caves with small mouths, so that when the outside air pressure drops all the air in the cave rushes out through the entrance allowing you to do some amusing things with bloomers.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bernieandjude/7009895295/" title="Crossing the Nullarbor by Bernie Sumption, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7072/7009895295_0e3cb86d07_z.jpg" width="640" height="495" alt="Crossing the Nullarbor"></a></p>
<p>More people lived here back in the 19th century when the main mode of transport was camels and the journey across the plain took months <i>[these days the 4.5 litre V8 diesel Toyota Landcruiser seems to be more in vogue &#8211; Bernie]</i>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bernieandjude/7009897901/" title="Crossing the Nullarbor by Bernie Sumption, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7192/7009897901_7842d499a5_z.jpg" width="640" height="358" alt="Crossing the Nullarbor"></a></p>
<p>But the most shocking thing about the Nullarbor (from the latin Nullus &#8211; &#8220;bugger all in the way of&#8221; &#8211; and Arbor &#8211; &#8220;Trees&#8221;) is that the western half has trees on it. Lot&#8217;s of trees. So many trees in fact that it&#8217;s much easier to see the blue haze eucalypts are famous for here than it is back in the Blue Mountains near Sydney.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[After spending a day on the water with Rob and Judie I now totally get why people spend so much time fishing - it's addictive and tasty! <a href="http://bernieandju.de/2012/03/23/the-day-i-got-hooked-on-fishing/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We arrived in Streaky Bay thinking it would be our last stop in civilisation before making tracks across the Nullarbor. We found the busiest campsite we have ever seen:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bernieandjude/7007617731/" title="Streaky Bay fishing trip by Bernie Sumption, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7092/7007617731_bbb2df4d79_z.jpg" width="640" height="253" alt="Streaky Bay fishing trip"></a></p>
<p>We squeezed our tent into the last spot on the site and settled down to enjoy civilisation with half of Australia. We soon got talking to two locals Judie and Rob who told us that everybody was there for the superlative fishing. Rob&#8217;s an expert fisherman and offered to take us out with him the next day so we could see for ourselves.</p>
<p>First up we needed to acquire some bait. These things are known as razor fish &#8211; they don&#8217;t look particularly like razors or fish but the King George Whiting are mad for what&#8217;s inside them, which is a bit like a scallop:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bernieandjude/6861486166/" title="Streaky Bay fishing trip by Bernie Sumption, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7111/6861486166_0a804d4a40_z.jpg" width="640" height="571" alt="Streaky Bay fishing trip"></a></p>
<p>After some expert tuition from Rob we got cracking:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bernieandjude/6861523320/" title="Streaky Bay fishing trip by Bernie Sumption, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7105/6861523320_b5c6db08b3_z.jpg" width="640" height="556" alt="Streaky Bay fishing trip"></a></p>
<p>And it wasn&#8217;t long before we hooked a couple of whiting each:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bernieandjude/7007606493/" title="Streaky Bay fishing trip by Bernie Sumption, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7192/7007606493_39f57a8b0e_z.jpg" width="640" height="539" alt="Streaky Bay fishing trip"></a></p>
<p>After a while another boat motored slowly past, some 50 metres away. Rob said &#8220;Queenslanders, pah. They&#8217;ve got no fishing etiquette. Don&#8217;t let on that we&#8217;re catching anything or they&#8217;ll be over fishing in our spot.&#8221; No sweat I thought &#8211; I hadn&#8217;t caught anything for a while. 30 seconds later I felt an enormous tug on my rod and reeled in not one but two whiting at the same time. I admit that at this point I got a little over excited and turned round to show Rob and Bernie before I&#8217;d finished reeling the line in. The momentum sent my line circling round the boat twice as Rob and Bernie jumped and ducked to avoid a fishy slap. <em>[There was an amount of whooping too &#8211; Bernie] </em> We were rumbled, oops!</p>
<p>After three hours or so on the water the fish stopped biting &#8211; partly because Bernie and I had fed them so much bait I think &#8211; so we headed back to camp to prepare supper:</p>
<p>Step one: scaling</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bernieandjude/6861495564/" title="Streaky Bay fishing trip by Bernie Sumption, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7103/6861495564_54a0a6eab2_z.jpg" width="640" height="360" alt="Streaky Bay fishing trip"></a></p>
<p>Step two: filleting</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bernieandjude/6861496292/" title="Streaky Bay fishing trip by Bernie Sumption, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7067/6861496292_3ab5fcaed2_z.jpg" width="640" height="584" alt="Streaky Bay fishing trip"></a></p>
<p>Step three: feed the head and tail to the appreciative audience</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bernieandjude/6861500100/" title="Streaky Bay fishing trip by Bernie Sumption, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7191/6861500100_fa92d3202d_z.jpg" width="640" height="404" alt="Streaky Bay fishing trip"></a></p>
<p>Step four: cook (this is Rob, by the way)</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bernieandjude/7007619315/" title="Streaky Bay fishing trip by Bernie Sumption, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7127/7007619315_207115afe0_z.jpg" width="640" height="575" alt="Streaky Bay fishing trip"></a></p>
<p>Step four turns this:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bernieandjude/6861498512/" title="Streaky Bay fishing trip by Bernie Sumption, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7214/6861498512_85de9bf2ed_z.jpg" width="640" height="376" alt="Streaky Bay fishing trip"></a></p>
<p>Into this:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bernieandjude/6861504208/" title="Streaky Bay fishing trip by Bernie Sumption, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7087/6861504208_bf82198d23_z.jpg" width="636" height="640" alt="Streaky Bay fishing trip"></a></p>
<p>Nom, nom, nom.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s important not to let the whiting have all the fun. It turns out that humans find razor fish exceptionally tasty too:</p>

<p>They taste like a cross between crab and scallop, are found only on the Eyre Peninsula and can&#8217;t be sold in shops or restaurants:</p>

<p>Perfect.</p>
<p>In Streaky Bay we feasted like kings and queens, learnt some new skills and made some fab new friends. Thanks for giving us a perfect dose of civilisation Rob and Judie!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The main purpose of our trip to Nieu Zarland &#8211; as the local&#8217;s pronounce it &#8211; was to catch up with the Rice-Grubbs. We spent a lovely three days with Phil, Rich and Sam at Rich&#8217;s parents house being rather spoilt by William and Elizabeth (thanks guys!).</p>
<p><a title="IMG_1907 by Bernie Sumption, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bernieandjude/6780597177/"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7163/6780597177_65c66dae8c_z.jpg" alt="IMG_1907" width="498" height="640" /></a></p>
<p>Phil and Sam both looking rather splendid at the Moeraki Boulders</p>
<p>But we couldn&#8217;t spend a week in the world&#8217;s adventure sports capital without doing something silly so we decided to test ourselves by going white water rafting down the Rangitata river&#8217;s grade 5 rapids.</p>
<p>It turned out that the white water was a piece of cake &#8211; neither of us fell out and we both managed to acquit ourselves adequately with a paddle. For proof of this please see the pictures below. Bernie&#8217;s at the front of the boat in a blue helmet and I&#8217;m on the second row in a green helmet. The lovely looking fellow in the gold helmet is our guide Duncan. When Bernie asked him if he could drink the water, he replied &#8220;Sure you can drink it. You&#8217;ll get savage fatal diarrhea, but you <i>can</i> drink it!&#8221;</p>

<p>But the ordeal wasn&#8217;t over &#8211; the most terrifying bit came at the end.  After watching everybody else do it there was no way I could chicken out of the 10m cliff jump at the end of the course!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Australia is a sparsely populated country far, far away from other English speaking nations* which means they’ve developed some enchantingly idiosyncratic turns of phrase.</p>
<p>* Even New Zealand isn&#8217;t that close &#8211; it&#8217;s as far away from Australia as Russia is from the UK.</p>
<p>Of course some Aussie lingo is internationally famous:</p>
<p>“No worries” is a two word embodiment of the Australian outlook on life; Male Australians do address everybody as “Mate”; And I knew I’d really arrived in Oz the first time a stranger said “G’day” to me in the lift.</p>
<p><span id="more-433"></span></p>
<p>And there&#8217;s some stereotypically aussie things that I have yet to hear anyone use:</p>
<p>Strewth, bonza, fair dinkum, flaming gallahs, tinnies, tucker and throwing shrimps on barbies must have all gone out of fashion.</p>
<p>But there are also some less well known words and phrases knocking about the lexicon:</p>
<ul>
<li>Across it –this is business jargon. Usage: “Are you across the TPS report?” Meaning: Are you aware of the contents of this totally pointless report?</li>
<li>Capsicum – a pepper, might be a bell pepper, might be a chilli – to be honest, I’m not entirely sure</li>
<li>Cockies – diminutive for cockroaches. We’ve been warned to expect a plague of giant cockies in summer ( joy! )</li>
<li>Convos, regos, presos &#8211; short for conversations, registrations and presentations respectively</li>
<li>Crazaroo – Crazy. Not actually a common phrase but too funny to leave out: a colleague recently told me he expected a conference to be Crazaroo.</li>
<li>Cruisy – This one’s quite different to what the rest of the world might think. In Oz cruisy people are just easy going dudes. They are NOT (necessarily) out looking for gay sex&#8230;</li>
<li>Degustation – Pronunciation: like devastation but with a g. Has the same meaning as dégustation but sounds hilarious when said in a broad aussie accent rather than an affected French one.</li>
<li>Doona –duvet, see degustation for what would have happened if they’d used the same word as the UK</li>
<li>Flick – Forward on an e-mail. Usage: “Let me flick this across to you”</li>
<li>Footy – a deceptively tricky one this. If an aussie asks you to the footy they could be inviting you to watch 11 blokes kicking a round ball or 15 men chucking an egg shaped ball across the pitch, or even an unknown number of men doing something unspeakable known as “Aussie Rules”</li>
<li>Lollies – Any kind of sweet, with or without a stick. This is particularly ironic when the sweet shop is called the British Lolly Shop like the one near our flat.</li>
<li>Panadol – generic term for pain killer, not one specific brand</li>
<li>Rugged up – a person who is wrapped up warm</li>
<li>Schoolies &#8211; when high school graduates go on holiday with each other just after their final exams. The rest of the country is generally horrified by their behaviour. Sounds pretty similar to spring break in the US</li>
<li>Screenies, stubbies and sunnies – screenshots, bottles of beer and sunglasses respectively</li>
<li>&#8216;Strine &#8211; The language spoken by &#8216;Strines. Or &#8220;Australians&#8221; in a dialect that doesn&#8217;t omit so many consonants</li>
<li>Swimmers – useful catch all term for bikinis, swimming costumes, shorts etc</li>
<li>Thongs &#8211; flip flops. Not the skimpy pants favoured by Peter Stringfellow</li>
<li>Toolies – people who are not high school graduates who hang around in areas where schoolies are behaving in a debauched fashion.</li>
<li>Uey – a U-turn. Note: one doesn&#8217;t make or take a Uey, one hangs, chucks or throws one. For instance &#8220;hang a Uey by the dingo Bruce&#8221;</li>
<li>Utes – short for a utility vehicle. They&#8217;re called pick ups in the US, bakkies in South Africa and they don’t have a special name in the UK. We are thinking of buying one to tour the country bogan style later in the year</li>
</ul>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We had a fun day out on Storms River. Apparently it&#8217;s the &#8220;elemental face of the Garden Route&#8221; (&copy;&nbsp;the&nbsp;Rough&nbsp;Guide). We found it fairly tame but maybe we were there on the wrong day&#8230;</p>
<p>We got kitted out in daft outfits and floated down the (really not stormy) river on inflatable rubber rings. As you can see the water was pretty shallow:</p>
<p><a title="Storms River, Tsitsikamma by Bernie Sumption, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bernieandjude/5637591909/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5228/5637591909_5caa110ef9_z.jpg" alt="Storms River, Tsitsikamma" width="640" height="593" /></a></p>
<p><span id="more-384"></span></p>
<p>The water turned out to be loads warmer than the thick wetsuits had led us to believe it would be, phew! We splashed around like big kids for a couple of hours and had lots of fun.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bernieandjude/5638157120/" title="Storms River, Tsitsikamma by Bernie Sumption, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5223/5638157120_14167822c2_z.jpg" width="640" height="452" alt="Storms River, Tsitsikamma"></a><br />
<a title="Storms River, Tsitsikamma by Bernie Sumption, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bernieandjude/5637585541/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5188/5637585541_0bb1de69cd_z.jpg" alt="Storms River, Tsitsikamma" width="640" height="441" /></a><br />
<a title="Storms River, Tsitsikamma by Bernie Sumption, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bernieandjude/5637589099/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5141/5637589099_525d378f67_z.jpg" alt="Storms River, Tsitsikamma" width="640" height="442" /></a></p>
<p>Afterwards we went down to the river mouth. We found that it was a whole lot more elemental down there, but that was mainly down to the sea rather than the river. After chucking a couple of stones in the ocean&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bernieandjude/5638326338/" title="Storms River, Tsitisikamma by Bernie Sumption, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5229/5638326338_ed93ef735d_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="Storms River, Tsitisikamma"></a></p>
<p>&#8230; Bernie went off and took some rather splendid photos, and no, I&#8217;m not at all partisan!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We&#8217;ve recently had the pleasure of catching up with Vanessa, Simon and Eden Lunn. They just happened to be on holiday in Cape Town the week after we met up with the Sumption&#8217;s, convenient eh?</p>
<p>We went out to Cape Point and discovered it was very windy:</p>
<p><a title="Cape Town by Bernie Sumption, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bernieandjude/5606739240/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5224/5606739240_50d9483b10_z.jpg" alt="Cape Town" width="640" height="480" /></a></p>
<p><span id="more-361"></span></p>
<p>Eden was less than impressed with this new worldly phenomena:</p>
<p><a title="Cape Town by Bernie Sumption, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bernieandjude/5606156339/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5028/5606156339_ae0afc7736_z.jpg" alt="Cape Town" width="480" height="640" /></a></p>
<p>We also met up with Madeleine Spring, one of our fellow volunteers in Tanzania. She arrived in Cape Town just before we started our SA road trip:</p>

<p>I must have said something very funny just before I took that photo! [that, or I&#8217;m tickling Mads &#8211; Bernie] </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Which means long journey or expedition in Swahili, and boy what an adventure we had. Back at the end of February we spent four days bumping along dirt tracks, being enveloped in dust and watching more and more bits fall off our jeep. </p>
<p>On the first day we got up early<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bernieandjude/5531952242/" title="On Safari by Bernie Sumption, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5015/5531952242_da69b796c9.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="On Safari" /></a></p>
<p><span id="more-310"></span></p>
<p>To take in an awesome view of Ngorogoro crater<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bernieandjude/5531932914/" title="On Safari by Bernie Sumption, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5293/5531932914_d85cba7486_z.jpg" width="640" height="175" alt="On Safari" /></a></p>
<p>Then we drove to the Serengeti national park and popped the top of the still largely intact jeep<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bernieandjude/5531370007/" title="On Safari by Bernie Sumption, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5052/5531370007_3941e3b077.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="On Safari" /></a></p>
<p>We found out that the trees in the Serengeti aren’t like trees in other places<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bernieandjude/5531955936/" title="On Safari by Bernie Sumption, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5099/5531955936_5f59cbb8cc.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="On Safari" /></a></p>
<p>They have leopards hiding in them!<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bernieandjude/5531936014/" title="On Safari by Bernie Sumption, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5252/5531936014_76ebe1665f.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="On Safari" /></a></p>
<p>We stopped for lunch on high ground so lions couldn’t eat us<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bernieandjude/5531935708/" title="On Safari by Bernie Sumption, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5255/5531935708_8d5a9569fb.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="On Safari" /></a></p>
<p>We spent the afternoon spotting more wildlife<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bernieandjude/5531958224/" title="On Safari by Bernie Sumption, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5014/5531958224_e8529e5eb8.jpg" width="500" height="370" alt="On Safari" /></a></p>
<p>After a good night’s sleep we got up early again to watch the sunrise<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bernieandjude/5531375547/" title="On Safari by Bernie Sumption, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5176/5531375547_e7d45fa455.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="On Safari" /></a></p>
<p>We drove back through the Serengeti to Ngorogoro crater and saw (very small) rhinos<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bernieandjude/5531355375/" title="On Safari by Bernie Sumption, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5211/5531355375_7b0250be18_o.jpg" width="390" height="260" alt="On Safari" /></a></p>
<p>We left Ngorogoro crater just before a storm came in and soaked all the other tourists<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bernieandjude/5531356083/" title="On Safari by Bernie Sumption, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5173/5531356083_e00c491bfc.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="On Safari" /></a></p>
<p>It was thanks to our awesome driver and guide Ben that we spotted all of this amazing wildlife</p>

<p>And the car didn&#8217;t really break that much &#8211; in four days there was a passenger door that wouldn&#8217;t stay closed, a flat tyre, loss of a lot of axle fluid and the shearing of one of the metal roof supports. Just a normal amount of broken stuff for Tanzania!</p>

		<description><![CDATA[It's incredibly humid. There's hardly ever electricity. And when there is electricity you get a shock when you plug anything in. Joy! <a href="http://bernieandju.de/2011/02/02/karibuni-tanzania/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We&#8217;re feeling pretty jammy that we left Egypt when we did. We&#8217;ve been in Tanzania for over two weeks now so we missed all the protests and disruption by a few days.  Instead, we&#8217;re lucky that our biggest problem has been getting used to the humidity and the super strong sun. We&#8217;ve been copying the Tanzanians by sitting in the shade whenever possible and drinking plenty of water (Yes Teresa, that comment is for your benefit!). It seems to be working &#8211; it now feels cooler than when we arrived but people who&#8217;ve been here longer than us assure us the weather hasn&#8217;t changed.</p>
<p><span id="more-222"></span></p>
<p>We&#8217;re living at Art in Tanzania&#8217;s volunteer house in Bahari Beach, outside Dar es Salaam. The staff call it &#8220;the hotel&#8221; but the locals know it as the &#8220;wazungu (white people&#8217;s) house&#8221;. We&#8217;re attempting to update <a href="http://artintanzania.org">artintanzania.org</a> but we&#8217;re frequently interrupted by power cuts. This area relies on hydro electricity and the last rainy season was poor so now they can&#8217;t provide enough power. The power company has published a schedule of cuts but do they stick to it? Of course not! The locals say the only way to get 24 hour power is to live on the same block as a politician.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve been getting to know the staff and other volunteers. Most people are European and most of the Europeans are Nordic but there are enough Brits for us not to feel unique. Bernie swapped south London-isms last week with Ian who was here with his fiancee Ingrid. They were here on a two week holiday from their London jobs &#8211; I&#8217;m seriously impressed that they chose to spend their precious holiday time volunteering with Art rather than on the usual Safari/Zanzibar tourist circuit.</p>
