				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We&#8217;ve been in Dar es Salaam for the last 6 weeks, working with an NGO that organises <a href="http://www.artintanzania.org/">volunteering in Tanzania</a>. Tanzania is sometimes delightful, sometimes infuriating, always humid and never boring. Here are 26 of our memories:</p>
<p>(I once said that posts to this blog would be short and to the point. Looks like I lied <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.3/72x72/1f609.png" alt="ðŸ˜‰" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<h2>A is for Amusing shop names</h2>
<p>Like the &#8220;Sick New Shop&#8221; and &#8220;Holy Spirit Driving School&#8221;</p>
<h2>B is for Beaches</h2>
<p><a title="Zanzibar by Bernie Sumption, on Flickr" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/bernieandjude/5493386801/"><img src="https://farm6.static.flickr.com/5211/5493386801_6f662def3e.jpg" alt="Zanzibar" width="500" height="333" /></a></p>
<h2>C is for Cuts, power of</h2>
<p>Like, all the time.</p>
<h2>D is for Daladalas</h2>
<p>Daladalas are omnipresent minibuses that ply the major and minor  roads near Dar es Salaam. Typically they are battered Toyota Hiace  models from the 1980s, and journeys cost from Â£0.15 for a few minutes,  to Â£2 for a couple of hours. They have no seatbelts, but that doesn&#8217;t  matter because:</p>
<p><a title="Blood of Jesus by Bernie Sumption, on Flickr" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/bernieandjude/5493973700/"><img src="https://farm6.static.flickr.com/5257/5493973700_ed69a90e44.jpg" alt="Blood of Jesus" width="500" height="375" /></a></p>
<p><span id="more-261"></span></p>
<h2>E is for Elephants</h2>
<p>Our safari guide doesn&#8217;t like Elephants. Big cats, says Ben, are too  lazy to attack you if you walk right past them, but Elephants have been  known to charge cars that they don&#8217;t like the look of. Plus they&#8217;re 3  times the size of the car, and have giant spikes attached to their faces.</p>
<p><a title="Elephants in the Serengeti by Bernie Sumption, on Flickr" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/bernieandjude/5493388979/"><img src="https://farm6.static.flickr.com/5055/5493388979_2537cea26e.jpg" alt="Elephants in the Serengeti" width="500" height="333" /></a></p>
<h2>F is for Fish Fillet &#8220;Nazi&#8221;</h2>
<p>I have <em>no idea</em>, and I decided not to find out by ordering one.</p>
<p><a title="Fish Fillet Nazi by Bernie Sumption, on Flickr" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/bernieandjude/5493379589/"><img src="https://farm6.static.flickr.com/5259/5493379589_a00bf81de4_m.jpg" alt="Fish Fillet Nazi" width="180" height="240" /></a></p>
<h2>G is for Giraffes</h2>
<p><a title="Some kind of horse, anyone know? by Bernie Sumption, on Flickr" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/bernieandjude/5493387829/"><img src="https://farm6.static.flickr.com/5057/5493387829_a033d17351.jpg" alt="Some kind of horse, anyone know?" width="500" height="333" /></a></p>
<h2>H is for Hippos</h2>
<p>These things are just overwhelmingly disgusting. In the dry season  the rivers dry up, leaving only pools of water in the river beds. The  prospect of spending 2 months in the same water isn&#8217;t enough to persuade  the hippos not to shit in it, which they do to the tune of 10 kilos a  day.</p>
<p><iframe width="640" height="390" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/-BoUrvA6NUE?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<h2>I is for Issuing new bank notes</h2>
<p>Out with the old, in with the new:</p>
<p><a title="Shillings, new and old by Bernie Sumption, on Flickr" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/bernieandjude/5493390097/"><img src="https://farm6.static.flickr.com/5099/5493390097_c468c6e35c_z.jpg" alt="Shillings, new and old" width="506" height="640" /></a></p>
<h2>J is for Jude!</h2>
<p>My always lovely wife-par-excellence.</p>
<p><a title="Sunrise on the Serengeti by Bernie Sumption, on Flickr" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/bernieandjude/5493984024/"><img src="https://farm6.static.flickr.com/5216/5493984024_0371fed283.jpg" alt="Sunrise on the Serengeti" width="500" height="333" /></a></p>
<h2>K is for Kilimanjaro rising above our balcony</h2>
<p><a title="Kilimanjaro by Bernie Sumption, on Flickr" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/bernieandjude/5493981674/"><img src="https://farm6.static.flickr.com/5217/5493981674_4f1aabae12.jpg" alt="Kilimanjaro" width="500" height="333" /></a></p>
<h2>L is for Lions</h2>
<p>&#8220;Hic svnt leones&#8221; read the medieval maps as an excuse for the large blank area over East Africa. <em>Here be lions</em>. This particular lion was about 2 meters from the car window.</p>
<p><a title="Hic svnt leones by Bernie Sumption, on Flickr" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/bernieandjude/5493982864/"><img src="https://farm6.static.flickr.com/5215/5493982864_fd62126d77.jpg" alt="Hic svnt leones" width="500" height="333" /></a></p>
<h2>M is for Masai Worriers</h2>
<p>Our favourite typo on the Art in Tanzania website. An honourable mention also goes to:</p>
<p><em>All projects have continuous assessment and supervision, so that  you can build upon the work of your predeceasing volunteers and pass  things over smoothly to your successors</em></p>
<p>That said, <strong>M</strong> could also have been for Mosquitoes.</p>
<h2>N is for Nguvu ya Umeme</h2>
<p>The Swahili word for electricity, literally meaning &#8220;power of  lightning&#8221;. Like lightning, it is a rare occurrence, and you can never  tell where it will strike next.</p>
<p><em>Tafadhali, tutapata nguvu ya umeme kesho? &#8211; Excuse me, will we have the power of lightning tomorrow?</em></p>
<h2>O is for Outboard motors and wholesale boxes of eggs</h2>
<p>The dual specialities of one shop in Zanzibar Town. This commendable  diversification in core competencies doubtless enables the shop&#8217;s owner  to target the cash-rich Pastry Chef Cum Watersports Instructor sector.  Either that or they&#8217;re using the eggs as a component in repairing the  engines. Neither would surprise me.</p>
<h2>P is for Power cuts, frequent</h2>
<p>Though the candlelit dinners that result are quite nice:</p>
<p><a title="Candlelit dinner in Dar es Salaam by Bernie Sumption, on Flickr" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/bernieandjude/5493430965/"><img src="https://farm6.static.flickr.com/5258/5493430965_1f3bddfd3b.jpg" alt="Candlelit dinner in Dar es Salaam" width="500" height="333" /></a></p>
<h2>Q is for&#8230; wait, no it isn&#8217;t</h2>
<p>There is no &#8220;Q&#8221; in the Swahili alphabet, a fact doubtless correlated  to the Tanzanian inability to queue (although they can form a great  rugby scrum in front of a bus door).</p>
<h2>R is for Reading the Kindle by Candlelight</h2>
<p>During &#8211; you guessed it &#8211; a power cut. There&#8217;s something pleasing about this combination of high and low tech.</p>
<h2>S is for Swahili</h2>
<p>The marvellously alliterative language of Tanzania and much of East  Africa, that gives us phrases like &#8220;Hipo lipo wapi&#8221; (&#8220;Where is the  hippo&#8221;, pronounced <em>Hippalippawappy</em>).</p>
<p>It&#8217;s easy to learn, because the people here are so friendly.<em><br />
</em></p>
<h2>T is for Time</h2>
<p>The Swahili time system dates from before people had watches. The day is divided into sections &#8211; <em>Alfajiri</em> (very early morning), <em>Asabuhi</em> (morning), <em>Mchana</em> (lunchtime), <em>Alisili</em> (afternoon), <em>Jioni</em> (evening), <em>Usiku</em> (night) and <em>Usiku wa majogoo</em> (dead of night, literally <em>Night with cockerels</em>)</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the fun part: if you use the wrong term, people will correct you, but <em>everybody has a different idea of when each block starts and ends</em>. This goes some way towards explaining the generally lackadaisical approach to timekeeping observed in Tanzania.</p>
<h2>U is for Ugali</h2>
<p>Ugali is a corn-based mush that tastes of either nothing, or whatever sauce you mix it with. We have it at least once a week, at the most expensive restaurant in town: the classily named &#8220;Budget Entertainment Resort&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/bernieandjude/5494218110/" title="Ugali by Bernie Sumption, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm6.static.flickr.com/5217/5494218110_d2cb51c4ea.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Ugali" /></a></p>
<h2>V is for Vexing unpredictability of powercuts</h2>
<p>Hey, I&#8217;m just going to use up all the letters I can&#8217;t fill otherwise with this technique.</p>
<h2>W is for World Trade Center, Dar es Salaam</h2>
<p>The <a href="http://www.wtca.org/">international organisation of two-towers fame</a> is opening up in Tanzania, and through a series of coincidences and introductions, I ended up being the official photographer at the launch of the World Trade Center, Dar es Salaam.</p>
<p><a title="World trade center, Dar es Salaam by Bernie Sumption, on Flickr" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/bernieandjude/5493980638/"><img src="https://farm6.static.flickr.com/5256/5493980638_14a6f14516.jpg" alt="World trade center, Dar es Salaam" width="500" height="377" /></a></p>
<h2>X is for X, being the international symbol for &#8220;off&#8221;, and applicable to the prevailing condition of the electrical supply</h2>
<p>Doing well, only a few more letters to go!</p>
<h2>Y is for konYagi</h2>
<p>OK, I cheated on this one, but really, what words start with &#8220;Y&#8221;?</p>
<p>Konyagi is a local spirit made from sugar cane. It&#8217;s like a slightly lighter (30%) and relatively inoffensive version of gin, with mercifully little flavour. It comes in little plastic sachets that the barman cuts open with a knife and hands to you through a security grille. The name comes from a Swahili-fication of the word &#8220;Cognac&#8221;.  Dream on.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/bernieandjude/5496512510/" title="Konyagi by Bernie Sumption, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm6.static.flickr.com/5173/5496512510_92ebaaf315.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Konyagi" /></a></p>
<h2>Z is for Zanzibar</h2>
<p>The island off the coast of Tanzania near Dar es Salaam. The beaches on the east are a peaceful paradise, and Stone Town is a colourful bustle of tourists in bikinis, Mullahs preaching on street corners, capoeira dancers on beaches and kids jumping off any available surface into the lukewarm sea:</p>
<p><a title="Kids in Zanzibar by Bernie Sumption, on Flickr" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/bernieandjude/5493421045/"><img src="https://farm6.static.flickr.com/5220/5493421045_5e0f247327.jpg" alt="Kids in Zanzibar" width="500" height="333" /></a></p>
<h2>The end!</h2>
<p>If you stayed with me for this long, <em title="thankyou">asante sana</em> and <em title="goodbye">kwa heri</em>.</p>
<p>Bernie     :o)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We&#8217;re feeling pretty jammy that we left Egypt when we did. We&#8217;ve been in Tanzania for over two weeks now so we missed all the protests and disruption by a few days.  Instead, we&#8217;re lucky that our biggest problem has been getting used to the humidity and the super strong sun. We&#8217;ve been copying the Tanzanians by sitting in the shade whenever possible and drinking plenty of water (Yes Teresa, that comment is for your benefit!). It seems to be working &#8211; it now feels cooler than when we arrived but people who&#8217;ve been here longer than us assure us the weather hasn&#8217;t changed.</p>
<p><span id="more-222"></span></p>
<p>We&#8217;re living at Art in Tanzania&#8217;s volunteer house in Bahari Beach, outside Dar es Salaam. The staff call it &#8220;the hotel&#8221; but the locals know it as the &#8220;wazungu (white people&#8217;s) house&#8221;. We&#8217;re attempting to update <a href="http://artintanzania.org">artintanzania.org</a> but we&#8217;re frequently interrupted by power cuts. This area relies on hydro electricity and the last rainy season was poor so now they can&#8217;t provide enough power. The power company has published a schedule of cuts but do they stick to it? Of course not! The locals say the only way to get 24 hour power is to live on the same block as a politician.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve been getting to know the staff and other volunteers. Most people are European and most of the Europeans are Nordic but there are enough Brits for us not to feel unique. Bernie swapped south London-isms last week with Ian who was here with his fiancee Ingrid. They were here on a two week holiday from their London jobs &#8211; I&#8217;m seriously impressed that they chose to spend their precious holiday time volunteering with Art rather than on the usual Safari/Zanzibar tourist circuit.</p>
